      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Kayle. I'm an American expat living in the UK. I'm passionate about art, sustainable living, accessibility advocacy, and food! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are cooking, traveling, reading, yoga, watching movies, and hiking. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't really have a dream job; never have. I've spent years working in art museums as an arts educator and cultural accessibility expert running programs for visitors with disabilities, leading accessibility trainings, and advocating for change. Shifting into web development, I'm particularly interested in database design and digital accessibility, so I'd love to work somewhere within those areas, maybe even doing consulting for cultural organisations.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Birmingham, England.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm interested in web development becuase it can offer a challenging, flexible, and project-based work environment in an in-demand and highly-valued field. I also hope to eventually be able to put my skills to use helping organisations make their digital presence fully accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
